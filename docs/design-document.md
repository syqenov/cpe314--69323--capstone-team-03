# Pet Shelter & Adoption Tracker
## Project Design Document

### Introduction & Project Overview

  The Pet Shelter & Adoption Tracker is a Java desktop application designed to help animal shelter staff manage intake, waitlists, and adoptions in one offline-first tool. Many small shelters rely on scattered spreadsheets and paper records, making it difficult to track animal stays and adoption demand. Our application centralizes these operations: it models species with distinct care schedules, manages adoption waitlists using queues, enables status undo operations via a stack, and supports bulk historical CSV log imports. Integrated pet APIs (Dog CEO API and TheCatAPI) auto-fill sample images and breed details, while built-in analytics render adoption trends and stay durations as visual bar charts to assist staff in operational planning. 

### Preliminary ER Sketch & Team Roles

### Table 1: Preliminary Entities and Key Attributes

| Entity | Key Attributes |
|---|---|
| Classification | id (PK), name, parent_id (FK → Classification.id) |
| Animal | id (PK), name, species, breed, age_months, intake_date, status, image_url, classification_id (FK → Classification.id) |
| Adopter | id (PK), name, email (unique), phone |
| AdoptionRecord | id (PK), animal_id (FK → Animal.id), adopter_id (FK → Adopter.id), adoption_date, fee_paid |
| WaitlistEntry | id (PK), animal_id (FK → Animal.id), adopter_id (FK → Adopter.id), requested_at, position |

### Table 2: Preliminary Relationships and Cardinality

| Parent Entity | Relationship | Child Entity | Foreign Key | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classification | 1:M | Classification | parent_id (nullable) | Self-referencing taxonomy tree of any depth, e.g., Dog → Sporting Group → Retriever → Golden Retriever |
| Classification | 1:M | Animal | classification_id | Each animal belongs to one classification |
| Animal | 1:M | AdoptionRecord | animal_id | An animal can have adoption records |
| Adopter | 1:M | AdoptionRecord | adopter_id | An adopter can adopt multiple animals |
| Animal | 1:M | WaitlistEntry | animal_id | An animal can have many adopters waiting |
